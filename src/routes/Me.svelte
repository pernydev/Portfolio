	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		Crafting user friendly and aesthetic Ul designs is not just my profession, its my passion.
		Taking a complex idea and bringing life to it through design, brings me a great sense of
		satisfaction. I strive to make every design unique, with the user in mind, always aiming to add
		value to the user experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		I possess extensive expertise in <a href="/projects?tech=react">React</a> and the <a href="/projects?tech=nextjs">Next.js</a> framework. Recently, I ventured into
		<a href="/projects?tech=svelte">Svelte</a> (alongside <a href="/projects?tech=svelte">SvelteKit</a>), and I must say, I am absolutely thrilled with it! Svelte has truly
		captured my heart, surpassing my fondness for React. I am eagerly looking forward to
		incorporating it more frequently in my future projects. Typically, my workflow involves crafting
		the design in <a href="/projects?tech=figma">Figma</a> before delving into coding in VSCode, where I utilize <a href="/projects">Git</a> for version
		control.
